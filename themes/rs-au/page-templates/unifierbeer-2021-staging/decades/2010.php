                        <p>In the 2010s, the digital revolution had well and truly taken over. The world’s entire music library became available inside a smartphone. With the advancement of technology, anyone with a laptop and a guitar became able to record a masterpiece in their bedroom and share it with the world. Spurred on by increased connectivity, new talent was able to break through from all corners of the globe––with artists proudly wearing their independence as a badge of honour.</p>
                        <p>Notably, the Black Lives Matter movement rises to prominence. It’s spearheaded by Kendrick Lamar’s anti-racist anthem “Alright”. Lamar’s masterpiece album To Pimp a Butterfly becomes a modern classic. Global protests begin to take place, as a new coalition of young people––more diverse than ever––demand equality for all. The galvanising sounds of Beyonce, Jay-Z, and Run the Jewels offer a modern soundtrack for protests, inspired by the massive social movements that have come before. </p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, the #MeToo movement rattles hierarchies to their core, changing the entertainment and music industry landscape forever. Acts including Fiona Apple, Stella Donnelly, Kesha and Lady Gaga all release tracks that rise to meet the moment and encourage women across the globe to share their story and have their voices heard.</p>
