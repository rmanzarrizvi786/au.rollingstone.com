                        <p>In the 2000s, indie rock and emo dominated the charts as skinny-jeaned rock revivalists took over stages across the globe. Millennials grew up to the sounds of Tegan and Sara, The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Armed with Tumblr, a Motorola flip phone and the birth of social media––young people became adept at using the internet to discover new music, alternative communities and non-conformist subcultures.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, the US and its allies were dragged into a new war. Consequently, America's engagement in Afghanistan became the most protracted war in American history. At the time, anti-Bush and anti-war pop punk exploded through the Walkmans of kids across the globe. Green Day became modern-day heroes, offering polished anti-establishment tracks for the 21st century.</p>
                        <p>The Chicks (formerly known as The Dixie Chicks) took a stand at a now-iconic concert at London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire Theatre. Their anti-war remarks led to their albums being burned in American streets and blacklisted from country radio––but cemented their status as contemporary music revolutionaries.</p>

                        <p>The 2000s marked a changing of the guard. New musical icons emerged, offering new causes and flags for a new generation of fans to rally around.</p>
