                        <p>Big hair, synths, and drum machines. The sounds of the 80s were inspired by the future; a synergy between human and machine. From power ballads to finger-tapped guitar solos, yacht rock to slow-burning R&B—music became increasingly diverse. In a stunning show of solidarity, Queen put on a career-defining performance at Live Aid. The festival pooled millions of dollars to combat famine in Ethiopia.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, a modern punk resurgence was underway, this time with a pointed focus: political and often controversial lyrics that attacked the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, and colonialism.</p>
                        <p>One band that spearheaded this resurgence were The Dead Kennedys. The band’s iconic track “Nazi Punks Fuck Off” has gone on to become an anti-fascist anthem, as relevant today as it was upon its release.</p>

                        <p>Whether it was the sounds of anguished punk or disco-soaked backbeats, the sentiment of the 70s still rings true today.</p>
