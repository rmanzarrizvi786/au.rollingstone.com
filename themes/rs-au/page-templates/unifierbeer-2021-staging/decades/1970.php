                        <p>As the hippies faded from view, a new sound emerged: the white-hot, unhinged noise of punk. Teeming with raw aggression and break-neck guitar riffs, punk became the definitive anti-establishment soundtrack pioneered by youth in revolt.</p>
                        <p>The 'peace and love' philosophy of the 60s had transformed into something new: the confrontational music of the anti-war movement. No longer was John Lenon a fresh-faced Beatle singing about the saccharine joys of holding your sweetheart's hand. Instead, he was a long-haired antihero. A beatnik troubadour. A political force to be reckoned with. &quot;I wanted to put what I felt about revolution [into music],&quot; said Lennon in an infamous <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lennon-remembers-part-two-187100/" target="_blank" class="text-yellow">1970 Rolling Stone cover story</a>. &quot;I thought it was time we fuckin’ spoke about it.&quot;</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, the sounds of disco were born inside the sweaty clubs of NYC; a scene that originated from black and queer communities as a safehaven from social turmoil. The Village People turned masculine stereotypes into fodder for cheeky, subversive disco classics before Donna Summer released the iconic “I Feel Love”––a track that would go on to become an <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/25-essential-lgbtq-pride-songs-199348/donna-summer-i-feel-love-1977-120077/" target="_blank" class="text-yellow">LGBTIQ+ pride anthem</a>. In Greenwich Village, the Stone Wall Riots marked a turning point for the queer community as demonstrations spilt out into the streets with a seminal march for equality against police oppression.</p>
