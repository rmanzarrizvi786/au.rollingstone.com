                        <p>The 90s changed everything. The birth of hip hop set the West Coast and East Coast alight––becoming the poetry of the streets and a mouthpiece for oppressed youth.</p>
                        <p>A movement that centred the Black experience took hold and spread across the globe as rappers including Tupac, Lil Kim, Nas, and NWA became household names. Together, they bring issues of Black liberation, police brutality, the prison industrial complex and more to the national conversation––preaching unity over hate and equality over division.</p>

                        <p>The Rodney King and Amadou Diallo protests became a catalyst for musical inspiration as hip hop became increasingly political. Most notably, NWA’s “Fuck the Police” became an anthem against police brutality. It still is today.</p>
                        <p>“Why did we make those kind of records? We were living in the middle of dope dealing, gangbanging, police brutality, fucking Reaganomics, and there was nowhere to escape,” said <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/n-w-a-american-gangstas-73485/" target="_blank" class="text-yellow">NWA member Ice Cube to Rolling Stone</a>.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the birth of hip hop offered hope. Black culture had broken into the mainstream. Through music, key issues of the time––all of which persist today––were talked about in a way that was unheard of before rap. The legacy of this era is undeniable and still felt on the airwaves––and in the streets––today.</p>
