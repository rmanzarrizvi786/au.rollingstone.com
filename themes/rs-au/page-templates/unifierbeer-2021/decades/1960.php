                        <p>At the dawn of the 60s, the sounds of revolution were in the air. Electric guitars, mop tops, free love, and a burgeoning fascination with psychedelics all infiltrated society. Norms were upheaved as the rigidity of gender roles began to be questioned. It all culminated at Woodstock, as bare-footed young people came together under the banner of peace and social change in a counterculture event that defined a generation.</p>
                        <p>Senior Rolling Stone US editor David Fricke was at Woodstock when the action all played out. Funnily enough, his standout memory is not the scorching guitar solo Hendrix played over “The Star-Spangled Banner”. Instead, it’s a story of spaghetti and hot dogs.</p>

                        <p>Woodstock was an “exhilarating series of minor epiphanies,&quot; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/woodstock-69-david-fricke-rock-roll-memories-854809/" target="_blank" class="text-black">recalls Fricke</a>. &quot;One of those moments came for me on Saturday morning when a wet, dishevelled freak came up to our campsite and asked my friend Wayne and me if we could spare a plateful of our undercooked spaghetti and hot dogs. Sure, man, chow down. In turn, he offered us a tab of what he swore was top-drawer acid. We politely declined.&quot;</p>
                        <p>In the 60s, a generation with brand new ideals came of age. Things were about to change forevermore.</p>
