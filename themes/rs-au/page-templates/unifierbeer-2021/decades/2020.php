                        <p>As we enter the 2020s, we see the death of the genre. Music is no longer boxed into a time, place or category but rather treated as something fluid. Black Lives Matter comes to the forefront of culture, as a global movement takes to the streets to demand justice. As they march, we hear diverse sounds––sounds as diverse as those demanding change. The work isn’t done yet, but progress is being made as the next generation of changemakers arise.</p>
                        <p>In Australia, the Change the Date movement and the ongoing push for Indigenous Australian equality has become a key issue of the moment. Already, musicians have banded together to create music to inspire change, carrying on the noble tradition that’s come before them.</p>

                        <p>The story of the 2020s is being written as we speak. Its future is yet to be written. However, we know that music will do what it has done for generations––to act as The Unifier we need.</p>
