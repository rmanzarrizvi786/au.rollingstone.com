// 	<p>Two years ago, Chadwick Boseman was in a movie called Gods of Egypt. It was not a very good movie. But in addition to its not-goodness, it also became infamous for whitewashing – casting, as ancient African deities, a white guy from Scotland, a white guy from Denmark and at least seven white people from Australia. Boseman, the sole black lead, played Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom and inventor of mathematics. Before the movie came out, an interviewer asked him about the criticism, and Boseman said that not only did he agree with it, it was why he took the part – so audiences would see at least one god of African descent. "But, yeah," he added dryly. "People don't make $140 million movies starring black and brown people."</p>
// 	<p>What a difference two years makes. Because now we have Black Panther – not just a $140 million movie starring black and brown people, but a $200 million one. It's very overdue. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created Panther, the first black superhero, way back in 1966, but he didn't show up on the big screen until 50 years later, when Boseman stole Captain America: Civil War. Now, after a decade of Marvel Universe films starring a demographically disproportionate number of white Chrises, the world finally has its first African superhero movie.</p>

// 	<p>"Chad gave a hell of a performance," says Michael B. Jordan, who co-stars as his archnemesis, Killmonger. "I couldn't imagine anybody else."</p>
// 	<p>A few weeks before the movie opens, Boseman is trying to lay low, sipping peppermint tea at the hipster L.A. coffee shop where he used to come to write, back when he was an aspiring screenwriter freshly arrived from New York. He's in head-to-toe black – cardigan, T-shirt, chinos, socks – except for some suede Valentino sneakers and a beaded necklace of Pan-African red, gold and green. He's tall and lean, with long, elegant fingers and the knuckles of a boxer. (Coogler says they would sometimes spar on set to get amped up.) One of his strengths as an actor is a quiet, intense watchfulness, and he's the same in real life, taking in the world with a skeptical half-squint. ("I see everything," Boseman says.) When he does speak, he's invariably thoughtful and thorough. "You're saying I'm long-winded!" he says, laughing.</p>
// 	<sg-insert>3.1.2</sg-insert>
// 	<blockquote>
// 		<p>"We were making a film about what it means to be African," Coogler says.</p>
// 	</blockquote>
// 	<p>In some ways, Boseman is a funny fit for a blockbuster action star. He's "90 percent" vegan, casually name-checks radical black intellectuals like Yosef Ben-Jochannan and Frantz Fanon, and says he gets anxious onstage or in front of crowds. ("Going on a talk show? Oh, my God. Nah.") But he also knows he's a conduit for something bigger: "I truly believe there's a truth that needs to enter the world at a particular time. And that's why people are excited about Panther. This is the time."</p>

// 	<p>After a long day of promo, Boseman is winding down at the Dime, a hip-hop cocktail bar near West Hollywood. He's with Logan Coles, his writing partner and close friend from Howard, and Addison Henderson, his friend and trainer. They're here to celebrate: In addition to the movie, Coles' lady is eight months pregnant with their first child. "She's about to pop," Boseman says. He raises his glass of tequila: "To new life!"</p>
// 	<p>While the DJ spins Tupac and Nas, they huddle in a banquette and plot what's next. We'll certainly see more of Black Panther this summer, when he'll team with Captain America to defend the world against an alien invasion in Avengers: Infinity War. But Boseman seems most excited to get back to writing. He and Coles are about to start work on a screenplay about a minister and anti-gang activist from Boston, whom Boseman hopes to play. They're also fine-tuning a script they wrote called Expatriate, about a 1970s airline hijacking, which Oscar winner Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) has already signed on to direct.</p>

// 	<p>Boseman has a lot he wants to do. "There's a plethora of stories in our culture that haven't been told, because Hollywood didn't believe they were viable," he says. "It would be cool to see slices of history that you haven't seen with African figures. Like Africans in Europe – the Moors in Spain. Or if you go to Portugal, they have statues of black people all over the place. So not only have we been here," Boseman says, "but we've directly affected everything that you think is European."</p>
// 	<p>"It's remarkable, man," Coles says. "I remember sitting in a coffee shop in Bed-Stuy, and we might have had enough money for two coffees. But we knew the homeboy that owned the place, they'd bring us soup, and we'd be there until night working on scripts. We never imagined superhero stuff."</p>
// 	<p>The waitress delivers more shots, and Boseman proposes another toast. "To seeing the movie," he says. "And to knowing that it's good!"</p>
// 	<sg-insert>3.22</sg-insert>
// 	<p>Before we part ways, Boseman has had a change of heart. He's talking about the Oxford trip – the celebrity who gave Rashad money. "After we got back, we got a benefactor letter," he says. "Denzel paid for me."</p>
// 	<p>Yes, that Denzel. "I'm sure he has no idea," says Boseman. "It was random." He wrote him a letter when he found out – "I couldn't wait to write my thank-you letter!" – but unless Washington is a hoarder or has a photographic memory, there's no reason to think he remembers an unknown college kid from 20 years ago. "I've been waiting to meet him, so I can tell him."</p>
// 	<p>There's a reason he didn't want to tell me before. "You never want to make someone feel like they owe you something else," he says. "They've already given you whatever it is they were supposed to give you. But I realized this morning that I've gotten to a point where nobody would think that." He smiles. "I don't need any more help."</p>
